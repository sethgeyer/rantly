#### A gSchool Graduation Requirement
The completion of this individual project is a graduation requirement for the Nov' 2014 gSchool class in Denver, CO.  The completed project is intended to be a reflection of what the students have learned over the past 6 months.  Students were provided user stories and mockups.

#### What It Is
Per the project write up provided by the gSchool instructors:  Welcome to the next big thing. We're going to take on Twitter.
Now-a-days everyone wants to communicate online, but they need more space! Twitter just isn't cutting it anymore. We're going to build a solution to that; rant.ly. This platform takes the opposite approach to twitter and forces user's to write *at least* 140 characters. Ha! Take that Twitter.

#### What Was Used
Rantly is a Ruby on Rails (v 4.1.4) application developed using test-driven-development methodologies.  Technologies used include PostgreSQL, Capybara, Rspec, Javascript (w/ JQuery), ActionMailer and Faraday to communicate w/ Keen I/O's API.  Students were specifically NOT allowed to use Devise(user login/authentication) or Twitter-Bootstrap for styling.
